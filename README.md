Solutions to challenges found at [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school/)solved with JavaScript and grouped by rating.

## Motivation
The best way to learn a language, spoken or otherwise, is to use it. To this end, this repo is a demonstration of my learning process applied to JavaScript.

I find this a useful exercise in learning the ins and outs of the language in extremely isolated contexts and find this isolation conducive to incremental learning (besides tons of fun).

## Disclaimer
This code will likely not be pretty or idiomatic, but those qualities aren't priorities here. My single goal with this project is to become more comfortable with the standard library and syntax of the language, not to produce top quality, maintanable code. I am completing these challenges as I would during a contest; quickly and efficiently.
